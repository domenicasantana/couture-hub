## Features

### User Accounts

Couture Hub is a web platform designed with user accounts specifically tailored for our fashion blog. Each user account is associated with a unique identifier, allowing users to interact with our blog features. These features include the ability to like and comment on posts created by other users. We've implemented a relational database schema to efficiently store user data and blog interactions. This functionality fosters an engaging community environment where fashion enthusiasts can share insights, ideas, and trends seamlessly within the web application.

* Users can create accounts if they want to use the blog by filling in a simple registration form.

![Registration Form](media/signup-mobile-view.png)

* Users sign in to their accounts by filling in a login form.
* The application uses Django pre written authentication to handle user signup and login functionality.

### Create new articles

As a crucial key feature of Couture Hub, it has been integrated Full CRUD functionality for the blog articles. This system is designed to ensure that admin user have exclusive access to create, read, update, and delete articles, providing them with comprehensive control over the content. Admin user can effortlessly create new articles, edit existing ones, view the entire article database, and remove outdated content.

On the other hand, regular users are granted read-only access to articles. They can explore, like, comment, and engage with any of the articles available on our platform. This two-tiered approach enhances the user experience, allowing our admin user to curate and manage content while enabling all users to participate in discussions, share insights, and appreciate the fashion blog articles. This Full CRUD functionality, combined with user roles, ensures a well-structured and dynamic blogging environment on Couture Hub.

* New blog posts (articles) are added by completing a form, which is located with a button inside of all articles in the blog page .

### Article management


* By design, users can only edit or delete their own  articles, as this prevents altering of other people's article posts. This allows the user to remain confident that their articles won't be tampered with.

![View of edit and delete for user's article](media/article_edit_delete_scre.png)


## E-Commerce store

The second core feature of TrueFit is the e-commerce store available for signed-up users, where they can buy training programs and meal plans from the owner of the site. This works with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)'s API .

* Customers can see a list of the available digital products in the training/diet plans section of the site.

![Digital products list](media/products_list.png)

* Alternatively if the customer wishes to filter the products based on category they can use the dropdown menu at the top

### Shopping bag

The shopping bag allows to see the user to see the total amount of the purchase before proceeding to checkout and it also has the functionality to update and remove the quantity of products

![Shopping bag](media/shopping_bag.png)

### Checkout

The checkout page has a form that collects the necessary data from the customer to create a payment intent with Stripe's API, it also uses Stripe's data validation to prevent the user from submitting the incorrec data which would prevent the order from submitting

![Checkout page](media/checkout.png)

* A very important feature of the checkout process is that TrueFit uses webhooks to protects the owner of the site of having payments going through without orders being submitted to the database. If the buyer closes the window while the order is still being processed, Stripe will save a copy of the order and update the database accordingly later on.

## Future Features

The following features could be added in the future, given more development time:


### 1. Account Management Tools

* Helpful account management tools could be provided, such as the ability to update usernames, email addresses and passwords.
* A password recovery by email function could also be provided. Django authentication tools could be used for this.

### 2. Article Filters

* The ability for all users to filter the articles by category.

 

### 4. Chat functionality

* The ability to chat with other users of the blog. Django channels could be used for this.

### 5. Code optimization and refactoring

* This was my first major project using Python and Django, so there are a few areas where I feel the code could be made neater and more efficient.
* In particular, replacing some function based views with class based view
