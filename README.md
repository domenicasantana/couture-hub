* Dark shade of grey is used on the login page  / signup page.

* Other buttons in the site use dark shade of grey .

* Shopping Bag page uses black shade for text and black and white colour for buttons.

#### Typography

* The website logo has created using font family: 'Times New Roman' . This font was selected to make the logo stand out with an animation .

* For the rest of the body website the font family was :'Marcellus'[Marcellus font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marcellus?query=marcellus) other text on the site uses the standard Bootstrap framework font stack, which consists of a number of simple, legible sans-serif fonts targeted at a range of different viewing devices.

## Features

### User Accounts

Couture Hub is a web platform designed with user accounts specifically tailored for our fashion blog. Each user account is associated with a unique identifier, allowing users to interact with our blog features. These features include the ability to like and comment on posts created by other users. We've implemented a relational database schema to efficiently store user data and blog interactions. This functionality fosters an engaging community environment where fashion enthusiasts can share insights, ideas, and trends seamlessly within the web application.

* Users can create accounts if they want to use the blog by filling in a simple registration form.

![Registration Form](media/signup-mobile-view.png)

* Users sign in to their accounts by filling in a login form.
* The application uses Django pre written authentication to handle user signup and login functionality.

![Login Form](media/login-mobile-view.png)



### Create new articles

As a crucial key feature of Couture Hub, it has been integrated Full CRUD functionality for the blog articles. This system is designed to ensure that admin user have exclusive access to create, read, update, and delete articles, providing them with comprehensive control over the content. Admin user can effortlessly create new articles, edit existing ones, view the entire article database, and remove outdated content.

On the other hand, regular users are granted read-only access to articles. They can explore, like, comment, and engage with any of the articles available on our platform. This two-tiered approach enhances the user experience, allowing our admin user to curate and manage content while enabling all users to participate in discussions, share insights, and appreciate the fashion blog articles. This Full CRUD functionality, combined with user roles, ensures a well-structured and dynamic blogging environment on Couture Hub.

* New blog posts (articles) are added by completing a form, which is located with a button inside of all articles in the blog page .

![Go inside of the blog page just for users](media/blog-howto-comment-first.png)

![Inside of the article click on the button add comment](media/blog-howto-comment-two.png)

![Fill the form](media/blog-howto-form.png)


* All articles are listed on the home page of the blog page but they need to be log in (Users only feature).

![List of articles](media/onlyusers-blog-view.png)

* Access to the blog is for users only . Inside of the blog page there will be a search bar(search for specific topics inside of the blog) allocated at the bottom of the page .

![Search bar](media/search_bar.png)


* If the person is not registered they will have this message show up .
![Blog Message](media/blog-blocked-message.png)

* Admin user account : This is the only user that has access to write post on the blog .
![Admin user page to write articles](media/admin-blog-form.png)


* When editing an article

### Article management


* Admin users are granted Full CRUD access on this website to ensure content quality, data integrity, and security. This approach minimizes the risk of unauthorized changes and data breaches, as admin users are accountable for content and user interactions. By separating content management from user engagement,we provide a more secure and efficient experience for all users.

![View of edit and delete botton](media/admin-blog-editdelete.png)


## E-Commerce store

This is another key feature of Couture Hub website ,it has not only a blog page but an e-commerce store available for everyone (Customers dont need to have an account to have access to the store products). This procedure its done and works with Stripe [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)'s API .

* Customers can see all the available products in the STORE page.

![products list](media/store-products-view.png)


### Shopping Bag

The shopping bag feature is a central element of the platform store, allowing customers to easily manage their selections. With this feature, customers can change(update) the quantity of items in their bag and remove items if they no longer wish to purchase. It offers a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience.

![Shopping bag](media/shopping-bag-feature.png)

### Checkout

The checkout page has a form which will collect all the customers necessary data . This data is crucial for creating a payment intent using Stripe's API, ensuring a secure and efficient payment process.Additionally, it has been integrated Stripe's data validation mechanisms to prevent users from submitting incorrect information. 

![Checkout page](media/checkout-payment.png)

* Another feature of the checkout is the use of webhooks as this will act as a safety net that ensures that payment-related data and events are reliably captured and processed, even if interruptions occur on the user's end or with the website's operation. This contributes to a more robust and resilient payment system.

### 4. Chat Within Comments Section:

*  Enhance user interactions by allowing them to engage in real-time conversations within the comments section. This interactive feature not only improves user engagement but also creates a dynamic and social shopping experience, where users can connect.

# Issues found during site development

* ## Edit Article view creating additional article instead of editing existing one



When editing existing articles, once the "Update" button was clicked, the edit article view would create an aditional article onto the database instead of updating the existing one

> This was due to the action attribute on the form pointing to the "articles:create" url, as I had copy the form from the article_create html template and had forgotten to delete this, all I had to do to fix this error was to delete the action as shown on the picture bellow.


![testing-issue-1](media/article_edit_bug.png)


* ## Secret Key being exposed

When first creating my project I forgot to add the sqlite database to the .gitignore which cause django's secret key to be exposed when pushing to github

> Thankfully gitguardian let me know almost instantly that it had happened, so I generated a new secret key and made sure to add the sqlite database to the .gitignore before pushing to github.

![resolved4]()

* ##  Images not loading from Amazon s3 bucket.


This one was a tough one to spot as I was sure that I had followed step by step the tutorial on storing static files on my amazon bucket. When I uploaded my files to my amazon bucket, the deployed site was not displaying any images despite the css styling being applied, telling me that the error was exclusively with the images and not all staticfiles.

> I have to give credit to the amazing CodeInstitute Slack comunity, which guided me in the right direction, it turns out that the url configuration is specific to the Region where the bucket is, and unlike the US region where the url just ends in ".s3.amazonaws.com" for the EU region the region has to also be added to the url, like the image shows below

![resolved]()

* ## Webhooks breaking the order submission

As a result of changing the STRIPE_CURRENCY variable at an early stage of the process, the deployed site would get stuck on the loading overlay (Check image) and the order would never be sibmitted to the database, it was very challenging to debug as there was no error to display or console to check as it was only happening on the deplyed site

![loading]()


## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
Screenshots are presented below:


Final results:
![performance_final](media/light_house_truefit.png)

I noticed that this tests scores vary from time to time and depends on external libraries as well. 

## Code Validation
 I used this websites to validate my code:
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS

 ![CSS validator](media/css-validator.png)

 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML

 ![HTML validator]()

 
 * [Pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) to test python files
